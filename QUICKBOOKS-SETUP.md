## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid Redirect URI"
**Solution**: Make sure you added the EXACT redirect URI to the Development section:
- Must be `http://localhost:8080/callback` (not `https://`)
- Must include port number
- Must match exactly what's in your app

### Issue: "Invalid Client"
**Solution**: 
- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check that you're using **Development** credentials, not Production
- Restart PowerShell to reload environment variables

### Issue: "Realm ID Required"
**Solution**: 
- Realm ID is obtained AFTER first OAuth authorization
- It will be saved automatically after you authorize
- The default sandbox company Realm ID is: `9341455168020461`

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Reload environment variables
$env:QBO_CLIENT_ID = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('QBO_CLIENT_ID', 'User')
$env:QBO_CLIENT_SECRET = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('QBO_CLIENT_SECRET', 'User')
$env:QBO_ENVIRONMENT = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('QBO_ENVIRONMENT', 'User')

# Verify
Write-Output "Client ID: $env:QBO_CLIENT_ID"
Write-Output "Environment: $env:QBO_ENVIRONMENT"
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to Git**
   - Credentials are stored in User environment variables
   - Add `appsettings.Development.json` to `.gitignore` if you store them there

2. **Use separate credentials for production**
   - Development credentials should ONLY access sandbox data
   - Production credentials are obtained separately

3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - If credentials are ever exposed, regenerate them in the Intuit Developer Portal

4. **Store production credentials in Azure Key Vault**
   - Wiley Widget already has Azure Key Vault integration configured
   - See `docs/Secrets.md` for details
