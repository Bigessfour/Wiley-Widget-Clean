## 🔒 Secret Management in Wiley Widget

This document outlines how to properly handle secrets, API keys, and sensitive data in the Wiley Widget project.

## ✅ Current Security Status

**Good News**: Our security scan shows **NO HARDCODED SECRETS** in the repository! 🎉

- ✔️ **GitLeaks**: No secrets detected in git history
- ✔️ **TruffleHog**: No secrets found in files
- ✔️ **Configuration**: Using environment variable placeholders correctly

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### 1. **Environment Variables (REQUIRED)**

**✅ DO**: Use environment variable placeholders in configuration files:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "${DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING}"
  },
  "QuickBooks": {
    "ClientSecret": "${QBO_CLIENT_SECRET}"
  },
  "Syncfusion": {
    "LicenseKey": "${SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY}"
  }
}
```

**❌ DON'T**: Hardcode actual secrets:
```json
{
  "QuickBooks": {
    "ClientSecret": "actual_secret_value_here"  // ❌ NEVER DO THIS
  }
}
```

## 🚨 What to Do If Secrets Are Exposed

If you accidentally commit secrets:

### 1. **Immediate Response**
```bash
# Stop! Don't push if you haven't already
git status

# If not pushed yet, reset the commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Remove the secrets from files
# Replace with environment variables

# Commit again
git add .
git commit -m "fix: use environment variables for secrets"
```

### 2. **If Already Pushed**
```bash
# Revoke the exposed secrets immediately:
# - Change API keys
# - Rotate passwords  
# - Update license keys

# Clean git history (nuclear option)
git filter-repo --path-based-filter 'path_to_secret_file'
git push --force
```

## 🔧 Tools and Commands

### **Security Scanning**
```bash
# Run security scan manually
trunk check --filter=gitleaks,trufflehog --all

# Continuous monitoring
trunk check --monitor
```
